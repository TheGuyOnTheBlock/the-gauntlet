            <h3>Passwords</h3>
            <p id="caption">by Anthony Dinh</p>
            <p>Passwords are important in cybersecurity in order to protect personal information and data for unauthorized access.</p>
            
            <p>In “Passwords, Passphrases, and Password Managers: Which Is Best?” by Mike Bianco, he states that “password managers can
            save you the trouble of having to remember dozens of passwords”. They’ll generate complex and unique passwords to store
            all in one place and help you know when you have weak, reused, or compromised passwords</p>
            
            <p>Passphrases are longer than passwords, containing space between words. It can also contain numbers of symbols. When
            using passphrases, they’ll usually have spaces between words, numbers, or symbols. It’s not recommended to use common
            phrases that can be easily guessed by someone.</p>

            <p>For stronger passwords, it’s best to have it at least 16 characters long. Mix them with different letters, numbers, or
            symbols. For a more superior protection, use multi-factor authentication and backup email. Should someone try to enter
            your account, the multi-factor authentication gives you control of approving and denying any attempts to login.</p>

            <p>In “What Makes a Password Weak/Strong?” by Justin Oliver from SandStorm, he states that “the strength of password is
            determined by 3 things: length of character first used, length of password itself, and the variety in characters
            chosen”. Basic passwords like “abcdef” or “123456” makes it easier for people to breach into someone’s accounts.</p>

            <p>When passwords are typed, they’ll usually be hashed out. Sometimes when they type their passwords, the letter will
            usually hash out after one letter was typed. Most (if not all) sites will have the option to show or hide passwords, but
            that puts a potential risk for people to get your password. In an event when you need to see the password you typed in,
            it’s fine to show the password by yourself like in a private room where nobody is around. But it’s not recommended at
            all where people can be around like run-of-the-mill public buildings.</p>

            <p>In conclusion, using passphrases is superior to passwords. However, there are advantages and disadvantages to using
            passwords and passphrases. The advantage is passwords are easy to remember, whereas passphrases they’re longer and more
            secure. The disadvantage is passwords may have a potential risk of people having a good chance of hacking, whereas for
            passphrases people may forget what their passphrases are. For ease of using passphrases to remember, we suggest using
            the first 3 letters that you can remember, then use numbers and symbols to create your passphrase.</p>

            <h3>Phishing</h3>
            <p id="caption">by Vincent Yip</p>
            <p>Phishing is an activity which involves sending misleading links to steal a person’s private information. It occurs in
            many different ways not limited to email, text message, social media, etc. You can report spam text messages on your iOS
            and Android by copying the message and sending it to 7726 (SPAM)</p>

            <p>⚠️TIPS TO RECOGNIZE AN EMAIL PHISHING ATTEMPT ACCORDING TO FTC (Federal Trade Commission)⚠️</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Generic Greeting” - A greeting that doesn't state your name as the recipient</li>
                <li>“Account on hold due to billing problem” - Something important or urgent has happened</li>
                <li>“Link invitation to update payment details” - This is the attempt to get the payload</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This incident occurred on December 3, 2013. Target got hit with a massive breach in which 70M PIIs (Personally
            Identifiable Information) were stolen and 40M of which got their credit cards stolen. The attack happened because there
            was a vulnerability in the website. What we can learn from this incident is that regardless who or what account passwords
            can be stollen it is important to wary of phishing attacks.  The key is to identify an attack whether it is before or after.</p>

            <p>Through doing this project, I believe that phishing is important to me because the targets at the highest risk would be
            the elderly since they did not grow up with the internet back then or have a strong aptitude for technology. It was the
            summer of ‘09 when I first got my laptop held for ransom, I didn’t know what to do so I told my dad to call the
            “Microsoft Tech Support”, since that incident I have been more wary of viruses and online scams.</p>
