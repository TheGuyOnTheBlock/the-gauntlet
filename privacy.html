        <h3>Data Protection</h3>
        <p>It is crucial to have protective measures in place to guard your digital personal information. Due to the fact that your
        information can be accessed quite easily through multiple means like social media and other online platforms, having
        ways to help protect your data is a must.</p>

        <h4>How To Protect Your Online Profiles</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Keep Things Protected:</b></p>
                <p>Despite how simple it may seem, having strong secure passwords along with regularly updating system and apps softwares
                as updates often include security patches that protect against malicious activity can help keep you secure. Make sure
                the WIFI connection you use is secure especially within your home. Avoid using public WIFI for sensitive transactions
                but if you must, make sure to use a Virtual Private Network(VPN).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Watch Out for anything phishy:</b></p>
                <p>A great defense relies on sharp senses, what I’m trying to say is don’t click on every link you are sent or interact
                with every prompt you are given as it can be an attempt of phishing. Be cautious and always double check what emails you
                get, what messages you receive, or what websites are asking for personal information. Always check for signs of phishing
                in any misspellings, generic greetings, too good to be true offers, and suspicious links. It may seem tempting to show
                off online but limit any personal information you share especially on social media. It can be as small as your date of
                birth or a slight glimpse of the street you live on. Review the privacy settings on all your online accounts to check
                and control who can see your information.</p>

                <p><b>More Upgrades People:</b></p>
                <p>To even better protect your privacy, use security software made to protect your devices against threats such as malware
                or viruses. Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software on your devices to protect your sensitive information.</p>

        <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
        <p>Digital privacy is about managing how you allow others to have access to your personal digital information. Maintaining
        and understanding your digital privacy is critical as it safeguards your sensitive information including, social
        security numbers, health records, and even financial data.</p>

        <h4>Keep Yourself Secure</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Don’t Blabber Too Much Online:</b></p>
                <p>In this day and age of digital technology, we frequently share our personal data through social medias, online
                transactions, and other online activities. This sharing can expose your data to risks like identity theft, fraud, and
                other malicious intentions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Hide Your Data:</b></p>
                <p>As a way to help keep your data safe, consider using encrypted connections to keep your vulnerable data away from prying
                eyes. Consider using VPNs and always make sure any sites you visit use HTTPS to help minimize the sources that your
                information can be exposed to.</p>

        <h3>Data Privacy</h3>
        <p>Data collection is the process of gathering and measuring information, in this case the digital information of users,
        which plays a crucial role in advancing knowledge in various fields of study. Depending on what data and why it is
        collected, it can provide beneficial results. When collected responsibly, this data has the potential to help improve
        and advance research, policy making, and overall service. However, when data is collected with malicious intent,
        especially digital personal information without the proper precautions, it can be quite harmful not only to the victim
        but also those around them. These harmful actions can stem from different sources like corporations stealing data from
        their users and scammers that find, steal, and exploit user’s data.</p>

        <h4>The Good</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Advancing Research</b></p>
                <p>Collected data is invaluable for studies and research in multiple fields from healthcare to different sciences. This
                provides raw information that helps in developing different insights, hypotheses, and developing innovative solutions.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Public Benefits:</b></p>
                <p>When such information is used ethically, it can enhance the quality of life for the common person by improving services
                and programs like education, public health, and urban planning.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>More Upgrades People:</b></p>
                <p>To even better protect your privacy, use security software made to protect your devices against threats such as malware
                or viruses. Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software on your devices to protect your sensitive information.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>The Bad</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Malicious Data Collection</b></p>
                <p>When data is collected with the intent to harm, it can be detrimental to individuals and societies. Malicious
                perpetrators such as scammers and cyber criminals, exploit the personal data of others for identity theft, targeted
                scams, and other mischief. These users manipulate user behavior to exploit vulnerabilities that may infect devices with
                malware and viruses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Corporate Abuse:</b></p>
                <p>Corporations sometimes partake in unethical data collection which consists of stealing user data or secretly tracking
                user activity to sell or use for personalized ads, which can infringe on user privacy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Hidden Tracking:</b></p>
                <p>Many apps may track user activity and other behavior without clear disclosure. THis tracking can lead to unauthorized
                data collection which puts users at risk of being exposed to targeted phishing, scams, and other breaches.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Data Leaks/Breaches:</b></p>
                <p>Due to poor online security from apps, websites, or organizations, sensitive data could be exposed causing harm to
                individuals, disrupting trust in digital platforms.</p>

        <h3>How to Prevent/Minimize Malicious Data Collection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Regularly check security of websites and apps:</b></p>
                <p>Ensure that websites and apps that you use are from reputable companies that have robust security measures in place to
                help minimize any data leaks and breaches. Stay informed about any data breaches that might have taken place previously
                to help you make more preventative actions. Use sites like haveibeenpwned.com to check if your emails have been caught
                in breaches or leaks.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Use secure passwords(Password Managers):</b></p>
                <p>Create strong passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid passwords with guessable information like birthdays, pet names,
                common words, etc. Utilize password managers to generate and store complex passwords to ensure your accounts are secure.
                Practice safe password practices like changing passwords every 90 days, utilize two-factor authentication, etc.</p>
            </li>

                greatly reduce the chance of malicious entities accessing your personal information.</p>
