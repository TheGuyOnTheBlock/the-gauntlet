            <h3>VPN</h3>
            <h4>What’s VPN?</h4>
            <p>A <b>Virtual Private Network</b> (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server, masking your IP
            address and location. This prevents ISPs from seeing your online activities, and makes it significantly harder for
            hackers to intercept your data.</p>
            <h4>VPN Perks</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Hides your IP address - prevents websites from identifying your real location.</li>
                <li>Encrypted internet traffic - Protectects internet traffic on public wifi and ISPs</li>
                <li>Bypass censorship - Access blocked websites in restrictive regions.</li>
                <li>Avoid ISP Tracking - Stops your ISP from selling your browsing data.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Best VPN Practices</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose a no-log VPN like Mullvad, ProtonVPN, or IVPN to ensure your data isn’t stored. (Avoid: VPN’s that log data (e.g.
                Express VPN, NordVPN, Surfshark))</li>
                <li>Use Stealth mode or Obfuscation to bypass VPN blocking (useful in countries with internet restrictions).</li>
                <li>Configure multi-hop VPN connections for extra security - Sometimes called tor browsing</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Browser Obscurity and Fingerprinting Prevention</h3>
            <h4>What is Browser Fingerprinting?</h4>
            <p>Even if you hide your IP with a VPN, websites can still track you through browser fingerprinting. This method collects
            unique browser details like installed fonts, screen resolution, and extensions to identify users.</p>

            <h4>Preventions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use privacy-focused browsers like Brave, Libra wolf, or Tor Browser. (Do try to avoid things like Chrome, edge and
                safari because they do collect telemetry and browsing data)</li>
                <li>Disable Javascript (or use NoScript for site-by-site control).</li>
                <li>Use CanvasBlocker to randomize fingerprinting data.</li>
                <li>Regularly clear cookies and use private browsing modes.</li>
                <li>Avoid logging into accounts that link back to your real identity.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="wrapper">
            <h3>uBlock Origin: The Ultimate Privacy Tool</h3>
            <p>uBlock Origin, it’s not just an ad blocker, it also blocks scripts, trackers, and malware.</p>

            <h4>uBlock Personal setting</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Enable EasyPrivacy and Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List in filter settings.</li>
                <li>Use medium mode to block third-party scripts by default.</li>
                <li>Combine with Decentraleyes to stop reliance on tracking-heavy CDNs.</li>
                <li>Block first-party scripts for extra privacy (but may break some websites)</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="wrapper">
            <h3>Private Search Engines</h3>
            <h4>Why Avoid Google?</h4>
            <p>Google tracks searches and build a detailed profile on users. Alternative search engines do not log your queries.</p>
            <h4>Great Private Search Engines</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>DuckDuckGo - No logs, but results are Bing-based.</li>
                <li>Brave Search - Fully independent index and no tracking.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Leak Prevention.</h3>
            <h4>How data gets leaked</h4>
            <p>Your personal data can end up in the wrong hands through multiple channels. Even if you think your accounts are secure,
            data leaks and breaches happen all the time.</p>
            <p>Many people forget about old accounts they created years ago forums, online stores, social media sites, or email
            accounts they no longer use. If one of these accounts gets hacked the credentials (email. Username, password, and
            sometimes more personal information like addresses or phone numbers can be leaked.</p>
            <p>Example: If you had an old MySpace, LinkedIn, or Adobe accounts, those services have all suffered major data breaches.
            Even if you no longer use those accounts, hackers can still use the leaked data to target you elsewhere</p>
            <h4>How to protect your Data</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>You can use something like HaveIBeenPwned to see if your email or passwords have been exposed in past data breaches,
                THis site scans billions of leaked credentials and tells you if your accounts have been compromised.</li>
                <li>If it appears to have been, immediately change your password for that account, Enable two-factor authentication. If the
                account is inactive delete it (and do delete unused accounts)</li>
